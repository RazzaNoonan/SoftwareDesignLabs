## Software Design Labs Overview

#### Lab 1: Caesar Cipher Implementation
Implements a simple Caesar cipher, showcasing basic encryption and decryption methods in Java. Includes an interface for cipher operations and a dedicated exception class.

#### Lab 2: Advanced Encryption Techniques
Focuses on more advanced encryption methods like AES, DES, RSA, and Vigenere ciphers. Features an abstract class for cipher operations, an enumeration for algorithm types, and a factory class for creating cipher instances.

#### Lab 3: Cryptography Lab
Continuation of encryption techniques, leveraging the previously defined abstract classes and interfaces. It includes a runner class that demonstrates the usage of different cryptographic algorithms.

#### Lab 4: Character Sequence Metrics and Builder Pattern
This lab covers the implementation of character sequence metrics (like Levenshtein and Hamming distances) and demonstrates the builder design pattern for constructing complex objects.
Other Labs (5 to 9):

#### Lab 5: Adapter and State Design Patterns
This lab focuses on the implementation of Adapter and State design patterns in Java. It includes classes that demonstrate the comparison of sequences using various algorithms (like Damerau-Levenshtein and Hamming) and adapts them for different interfaces. The lab also explores the state pattern to manage state-related behavior dynamically.

#### Lab 6: Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
In this lab, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern is implemented. It includes classes representing each component of MVC â€“ models (Customer), views (AppWindow, PolyPanel), and controllers. This lab provides practical insights into separating the application's data model, user interface, and control logic.

#### Lab 7: Generics in Java
Lab 7 delves into the concept of Generics in Java. It includes implementations that utilize generic types, demonstrating their flexibility and type safety in Java programming. Key concepts like generic classes, interfaces, and methods are covered.

#### Lab 8: Remote Message Service Implementation
This lab presents an implementation of a remote message service. It demonstrates the use of Java interfaces and classes to create a messaging service, including server and client components, service implementations, and remote interfaces.

#### Lab 9: Object Persistence
Lab 9 explores object persistence in Java. It includes classes for creating and managing customer orders, along with related entities like address, items, and customer details. This lab is useful for understanding object serialization, file handling, and persistent storage in Java applications.

#### Lab 10: Analyzing Structural Quality with Software Metrics
Lab 10 focuses on employing software design metrics to analyze the structural quality of the Apache Commons Text API. The use of software metrics in this lab serves as a quantitative tool to assess the quality of software design, providing insights into aspects such as complexity, maintainability, and robustness of software artifacts.
